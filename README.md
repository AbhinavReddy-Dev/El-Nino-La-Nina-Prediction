# El-Nino-La-Nina-Prediction
El Ni単o/La Ni単a are the Global weather conditions that lasts for at least 6-8 months or a year to over a series of years. These are either extreme drought conditions or extreme rainfall over the tropical Pacific Ocean. These are basically caused by the warming up of ocean surface which is now being effected by human activity (Global Warming). Deal is to predict the years that might be effected with El Ni単o/La Ni単a using the available dataset and time-series forecasting algorithm. Use of extensive libraries available for Python-Machine Learning will help us to attain a good result. This prediction will play a vital role in managing the resources through the countries that face this global phenomenal consequences.
